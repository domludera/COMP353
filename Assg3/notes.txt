Using the above relation schemes find the names of classmates 

(pairs of students) -> Student1, Student2

who have taken more than one course with the professor.
Express the query in RA. Note if there is the pair Name1, Name2 in the result, it must not have the Name2, Name1 as well!
If the query can't be written in RA, explain why.



-Check students who have taken the same courses -> return pair

-check who is the professor of the course

X = π Student.sid, Student.sname, Student2.sid, Student2.sname, Enrollment.cid (σ (Student.sid ≠ Student2.sid ∧ Enrollment.cid = Enrollment2.cid) ((Student ⨝ Enrollment) ⨯ ((ρ Student2 (Student)) ⨝ (ρ Enrollment2 (Enrollment)))))
