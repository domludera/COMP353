A participant can create a new group and hence become the manager of the group,
invite other participants of the events to join the group and admit those participants
who apply to join the group; post new items for the group. The group pages are not
accessible to anyone other than the group members; however any participant of the main
event can request to join a group. Membership of a group is visible to all members of
the group and they can send private communication or comments to another member
in the group. NO access is allowed to the group contents to participants not members
of the group.


Details about groups: Records of information on each group, owner of the group, list of
participants belonging to the group(group members). Owner of the group can add new
members or remove members from the group. Members of a group can share a forum of
information such as photos, videos and posts. Adding any member into a group requires
the knowledge of the personâ€™s SCC ID, email address, first name and DOB.




from HOME/home.php
GET /group -> groupController.index() => render(Views/Group/index)

- remember to check SQL with groups

Assumptions

$mails comes from mailController.index(), its init line11 by $results["mails"] = Mail::result...
								$this->set($results);

therefore in groupController.index(),
	$groups should be generated in a simil fashion
		$group = new Group();
		$group->partOf($_SESSION["user"]) => Group::resultToArray()
			assign ^ to $results["groups"];
		$this->set($results);



//TODO

create form in group for "name" -> groupName defined by user
create file "create.php" -> for group creation (see Mail/create for ref)
